# C-Piscine
My works during 42 bootcamp, the 'Piscine'


This git repository includes the codes of all the projects I havde done during the one month bootcamp of 42. This bootcamp is called the 'Piscine', it acts as the entry selection process to the school. I was required to code an average of 12 hours per day. 

You will find the subjects to the exercises, in the subject folder. Everything was coded by myself.
